## Several modifications have been made:
- Function to make snake dead if it hits the boundary wall
- Background music by Vlad Krotov from Pixabay
- Score bar

## Game Controls
- **Arrow Keys:** Control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).

## Game Rules
- Move the snake to consume more rats, increasing its length and score.
- Avoid collisions with the snake's own body to prevent game over.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the screen edges.
